"21",4,"I tried not use the rest trials at all because I knew there would be more monetary compensation.

"22",40,"Honestly, they were less engaging then to just do the main games, so I usually skipped. While at times I felt tired of the games and did the rest trials, I'd often get bored in the midst and just end them anyway.","A little bit. If I'd grown tired of a particular game I decided to take the brief break.","Not really","Somewhat. It wasn't my main focus but I did consider it, though severely doubted it would matter given my primary reason.","Slightly preferred the numbers as it was easier to keep in my head than to visually memorize the squares.","40","40","5","25","40","10"

"26",44,"I ended the rests pretty early because I didn't feel like I needed most of them and they were quite a lot so I skipped a bunch after 2 or 3 rest games","Yes a lot because the squares one starts pretty fast and is easy to miss a bunch of them in a row if you fail to catch the motion","No, it remained almost the same, at the end I was trying to click a bit slower because I if misclicked it was almost impossible to recover","No, I didn't feel like needing much of the rests","I prefered the numbers one because It felt like more fun, I don't exactly know why","15","30","80","50","70","10"
"27",45,"I found the rest trials to be more mentally fatiguing than the main trials. While I occasionally did the rest trials to give myself a change of pace from the main trials, I usually preferred to end the rest trials immediately.","Occasionally, I would do a few rest trials  as a 'mental reset' when the game was about to be changed.","No. My main challenge was maintaining concentration throughout the experiment.","No. There was no visual indication of how many endowment points I had remaining throughout the experiment. As such, it did not factor into my decision making at all.","I found the numbers game slightly easier as it required less concentration.","80","90","99","60","75","40"
"28",49,"I decided to always end it immediately it starts off!","No.","No","yes!","Not really, I rate both games the same.","1","15","15","40","80","40"
"29",5,"I was going from my own instinct and the ticking of the things appearing. It kinda stressed me on the ""rest part"" ","Not really, but I started being conscious about when the games would change and how it would affect my focus. ","It didnt change overtime but I thought I sensed some patterns in the order of how numbers or boxes appeared. ","No I did not, I was just trying to focus while being confused.

"32",54,"I never stayed in the rest game for a long time cause i find it to be extremely boring in comparishon to the other 2 games and i also wanted to end up with more points","Not at all. Both games were easy. I might liked the Square grid game a bit more","Nope. I didnt use any strategy at all","Yes. Thats 1 reason i didnt want to spend too much time in the rest game at all","I prefer square grid game more for the sole reason that i just found it more interesting than the number game","60","20","90","10","15","1"
"33",57,"due to being anxious to go the next game.","Yes.","Yes","not really i was more interested in continueing with the game and hoping for the number game because i find much more easy and it boosted my confidence","Yes i did preffered the number game A than the blue squares game.","1","60","40","35","90","20"

"36",61,"I just felt like doing all the other one's first.","Not really.","Not really.","I didn't stress. Even if I missed, there was still a 50% chance I'd be right. I'd really have to messs up to get those wrong.","Not really.","100","100","100","30","20","0"

"40",65,"i didnt want to lose points from my starting 600 so i tried to skip rest.","yes numbers were a better game for me.","not at all.","yes for this reason i skipped the rest trials and stayed focused in the main games.","yes numbers, because i could remember them easily. ","30","50","80","20","30","5"
"41",66,"When I really needed that time to refocus and recompose ","Yes","No","Yes I was","I preferred the number recalling game, I felt this was better suited towards my skillset.","25","50","10","25","60","1"
"42",67,"I let the time go by; I didn't want to finish early, even though it wasn't that restful.","No.","No, for the number game I tried to repeat them in my mind, while for the squares game I tried to follow them with the mouse.","Yes, but it has not been my priority","The squares game was more engaging.","70","50","90","40","50","10"

"44",69,"after 3-4 games.. i felt it is unnecessary to spend more time on trials.","No","No","not much","I'd prefer game A, because the location of numbers is easy and thus i can complete the game more faster than Game B","10","20","25","15","25","10"
"45",70,"Most of the time I skipped the rest trials right away. At a few occasions I choose to do them to let my brain rest after doing the recall blue squares challenge.","No, not at all.","No","No, I was listening to my body. When I felt like my brain needed a break I used the rest trials.","Yes, the one with recalling digits.","100","100","100","1","50","1"
"46",71,"I had more ""fun"" doing the normal trials, so I just did 2-3-4 of the rest trials to have a small pause between them.","I read about it, thought about it briefly but didn't really care much. Both were easy and made time pass more easily than the rest trials.","No.","Just a bit. I didn't do many rest trials, not because of the endowment points but because I preferred doing the other trials.","I felt the one with the flashing squares was slightly easier, for me.","20","15","60","6","5","3"
