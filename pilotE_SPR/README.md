This is the October 2024 iteration of this experiment, with self-paced rest periods. SPR = self-paced rest
The rest task and spatial recall are based off of the dsst task in the niv lab demos site
The digit span task was inspired by experiment factory digit span

Currently: 

Game A and Game B are counterbalanced to be either spatial recall or digit span
Current ordering (18 blocks): ABABBABAABABAABABB (9 As and 9 Bs)

**Practice**
1 practice spatial recall block (6 trials)
1 practice rest task block (6 trials)
1 practice digit span block (6 trials)

**Main Experiment**
ABABBABAAB

*Spatial Recall Block Specifications:*
1 normal trial is:
- 4 squares shown (each square shown for 375 ms + a 200 ms break between) = 4 * (575) = 2300 ms + 5000 ms response time = 7.3 seconds per trial

1 normal block is: 
- 12 trials * 7.3 seconds = **87.6 seconds maximum**

1 practice trial is:
- 4 squares shown (each square shown for 375 ms + a 200 ms break between) = 4 * (575) = 2300 ms + 5000 ms response time + 1000 ms feedback time = 8.3 seconds per trial

1 practice block is:
- 6 trials * 8.3 seconds = **49.8 seconds maximum**


*Digit Span Block Specifications:*
1 normal trial is:
- 4 digits shown (each digit shown for 375 ms + a 200 ms break between) = 4 * (575) = 2300 ms + 5000 ms response time = 7.3 seconds per trial

1 normal block is: 
- 12 trials * 7.3 seconds = **87.6 seconds maximum**

1 practice trial is:
- 4 digits shown (each square shown for 375 ms + a 200 ms break between) = 4 * (575) = 2300 ms + 5000 ms response time + 1000 ms feedback time = 8.3 seconds per trial

1 practice block is:
- 6 trials * 8.3 seconds = **49.8 seconds maximum**


*Rest Task Block Specifications:*
1 normal trial is: 
- 1000 max duration = 2 seconds per trial

1 practice block is: (TODO include the feedback too)
- 6 trials * 2 = **12 seconds maximum**

1 normal block is maximum:
- 20 trials * 2 = **40 seconds maximum** ?????

**FOR PRACTICE AND 10 BLOCKS:**
practice: 49.8 + 49.8 + 12 = 112 seconds = 1.87 minutes = 2 minutes
main exp: 18 * 87.6 = 1576.8 seconds = 26.28 minutes = 27 minutes max
+ 5 minutes for instructions 
+ up to 18 * 40 = 720 seconds = 12 minutes max of rest
= **MAX: 46 minutes**

TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE'S LENGTH IS THE SAME EITHER:
1) add the leftover rest trials to the end for everyone (so everyone ends up doing the same # of trials of everything) OR
2) cut the experiment early for people who rest a lot?

I think option 1 is better (TODO HAVEN"T DONE THIS YET)
