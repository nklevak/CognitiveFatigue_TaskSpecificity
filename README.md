This also repository hosts the task code, analysis code, and anonymized task data from several pilot studies (BDM_pilots_task_code, analysis/old_analysis, data_anonymized/original_pilot_data). Many of these pilots used the BDM (Becker De-Groot Marshack) auction to get at cognitive fatigue and task switching by allowing participants to bid to switch from one task to the other.
