# CognitiveFatigue_TaskSpecificity

This repository hosts the task code, analysis, and anonymized task data for the study "The effect of task switching on cognitive fatigue." The code is in task_code/Study2_SPR_task_code, the analysis is in analysis/Study2_SPR, and the anonymized data is in data_anonymized/SPRmain. The study was conducted in January of 2025, and the analysis for this study was done in Jan-April 2025. The cleaned up analysis file used for the initial CCN paper submitted under the same name is: analysis/Study2_SPR/full_relevant_analysis.Rmd and the data was pre-processed in analysis/Study2_SPR/study2_main_basic_preprocessing.Rmd. 

The relevant HMM modeling is in HMM_modeling/hmmlearn_implementation.

This also repository hosts the task code, analysis code, and anonymized task data from several pilot studies (task_code/BDM_pilots_task_code, analysis/previous_task_analysis, data_anonymized/original_pilot_data). Many of these pilots used the BDM (Becker De-Groot Marshack) auction to get at cognitive fatigue and task switching by allowing participants to bid to switch from one task to the other.
