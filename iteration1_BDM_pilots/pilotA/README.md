Based off of pre-pilot/spatial_recall_grad_cpt we selected a candidate difficulty of both the spatial recall task and the gradCPT task.

In this version of the pilot, we are keeping the difficulty consistent throughout 

The spatial recall aspect of the task was adapted from code by Sam Zorowitz from the niv lab, found here: https://github.com/nivlab/jspsych-demos/blob/main/tasks/spatial-recall/.

For the gradCPT portion, it was based off of information written in Esterman et al papers (link here) and then adapted to fit necessary specifications
