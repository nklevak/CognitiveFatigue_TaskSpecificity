The spatial recall aspect of the task was adapted from code by Sam Zorowitz from the niv lab, found here: https://github.com/nivlab/jspsych-demos/blob/main/tasks/spatial-recall/.

The digit span aspect of the task was adapted from https://github.com/mahiluthra/working_memory_tests/blob/master/digit_span_task.html

This is **pre_pilot_B** and switches out the go no go task from pilot A for a digit span recall task to ensure both tasks use the same type of working memory
