This is a readme for pilot D, which will be a small sample collected from Prolific. 

This is very similar to Pilot C (which was collected in person on Stanford's campus), but was altered to be more difficult. 

Specific changes that were made were:
- the contrast between the target and distractor rectangles in the VS task was reduced
- the the response time for each VS task was reduced by 500 ms (to 1500 ms, same as stimuli duration)
