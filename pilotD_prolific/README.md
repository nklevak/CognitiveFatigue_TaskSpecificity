This is a readme for pilot D, which will be a small sample collected from Prolific. 

This is very similar to Pilot C (which was collected in person on Stanford's campus), but was altered to be more difficult. 

Specific changes that were made were:
- the contrast between the target and distractor rectangles in the VS task was reduced
- the the response time for each VS task was reduced by 600 ms (to 1400 ms; stimuli duration ( was reduced to 1300 from 1500))
- vs fixation duration 400 ms instead of 500 ms
- for SR made each square appear for 200 ms instead of 350
- for spatial recall added a 10 second response time limit (before it was unlimited time, although people didn't use unlimited time), made it large in case someone is bad at using a mouse
- made time between each square flash 200 ms instead of 250 ms in spatial recall
- in spatial recall, changed length of stimulus hidden to be 350 ms instead of 500 ms


Increased number of blocks and decreased number of trials per block:

In previous pilot was:
- Practice: 16 VS, 8 SR
- Actual: 16 VS, 10 SR
- num blocks: 13

Now:
- Practice: 10 VS, 6 SR
- Actual: 12 VS, 8 SR
- num blocks: 18
