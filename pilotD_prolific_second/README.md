This is the second pilot D prolific sample, which is the same as the initial Pilot D but with slight changes to make the visual search slightly easier.

These VS changes are:
- making the stimulus duration = 1450 instead of 1350 like in the previous iteration
- making the trial duration = 1600 instead of 1400 like in the previous iteration

For spatial recall, the changes are:
- decreased the max response time to be 5 seconds instead of 10 seconds

Other changes:
- counterbalanced which order the practice happens in

Again, these are the numbers (and this task takes a median of 38 minutes):

For practice: 5 spatial recall, 15 visual search
For actual: 12 spatial recall, 30 visual search
Number of blocks: 20
