This is pilotD_modeling but with glms and glmms instead of lmer. 

This is from a 100 person "pilotD_second" sample conducted on Prolific from july 26 - august 6.

# TASK INFORMATION:
The spatial recall was 4 squares at a time, and the visual search was conjunction only and 24 items only. 

The setup was:
5 spatial recall practice
15 visual search practice

20 blocks
- 30 visual search per block
- 12 spatial recall per block


# SETUP:
## imports
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r libraries, include=FALSE}
library("knitr") # for knitting things
library("tidyverse") # for all things tidyverse
library("performance")
library(ggplot2)
library(see)
##library(jsonlite)
library("broom")      # for tidying up linear models 
library("car")        # for running ANOVAs
library("afex")       # also for running ANOVAs
library("emmeans")    # for calculating constrasts

# set the default ggplot theme 
theme_set(theme_classic())
```

## Data Loading:
Read in the data: (it's broken up across two folders)
``` {r data_load}

# first folder:
setwd("../../data/pilotD_second/prolific_original")

csv_files <- list.files(pattern = "\\.csv$")

# Function to read a CSV file and convert all columns to character type
read_csv_as_character <- function(file) {
  df <- read.csv(file, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
  df[] <- lapply(df, as.character)
  return(df)
}

df_all <- bind_rows(lapply(csv_files,read_csv_as_character))
``` 
``` {r data_load}
# second folder:
setwd("../../data/pilotD_second/prolific_copy")
csv_files <- list.files(pattern = "\\.csv$")

# there is some run_id overlap so edit all of the run_ids in this folder
temp <- bind_rows(lapply(csv_files,read_csv_as_character))
temp <- temp %>%
  mutate(run_id = as.character((as.integer(run_id) + 500)))
df_all <- bind_rows(df_all, temp)
```

## data wrangling & pre-processing:

Remove identifiers and uneccesary cols:
``` {r data_wrangling_anon}
anonymize_clean <- function(df) {
  df <- df %>%
    select(-recorded_at,-url,-ip,-user_agent,-referer,-sequence_length,
         -accept_language,-device,-internal_node_id,-view_history,
         -source_code_version, -contains("browser"),-contains("platform"),
         -contains("screen"),-contains("width"),-contains("height"),
         -contains("failed"),-condition,-success,-event_history, -block_num)
  return(df)
}
df_all <- anonymize_clean(df_all)
```

Create a column in df_all for participant ratings of task difficulty/boringness, and of their practice performance. Save all practice trials to a different df called practice_runs_df. Final cleaned df after this is df_all_cleaned
``` {r data_wrangling_add_cols}
# save practice to practice_runs_df
practice_runs_df <- df_all %>%
  filter(practice == "true")

# make a column for how much they rated vs and sr difficulty and boringness
temp <- df_all %>%
  filter(trial_type == "survey-text") %>%
  filter(str_detect(response, "bid_decision") | str_detect(response, "game_description") | str_detect(response, "boring") | str_detect(response, "prolific_id"))

temp <- temp %>%
  mutate(response = map(response, ~ jsonlite::fromJSON(.))) %>%
  unnest_wider(response)

feedback_temp_sr <- temp %>%
  filter(!is.na(sr_boring)) %>%
  select(run_id, sr_boring, sr_difficult)
feedback_temp_vs <- temp %>%
  filter(!is.na(vs_boring)) %>%
  select(run_id, vs_boring, vs_difficult)
prolific_ids_df <- temp %>%
  filter(!is.na(prolific_id)) %>%
  select(run_id, prolific_id)

df_all <- df_all %>%
  left_join(feedback_temp_sr, by = "run_id") %>%
  left_join(feedback_temp_vs, by = "run_id") %>%
  left_join(prolific_ids_df, by = "run_id")

# make a column for average practice score per participant and put it into the main df
temp <- practice_runs_df %>%
  select(run_id, trial_type, score_an, correct_trial) %>%
  mutate(correct = ifelse(trial_type == "spatial-recall",as.integer(score_an),ifelse(correct_trial=="null",0,as.integer(correct_trial)))) %>%
  select(run_id, trial_type, correct) %>%
  group_by(run_id, trial_type) %>%
  summarise(avg_correct = mean(correct)) %>%
  mutate(sr_practice_accuracy = ifelse(trial_type == "spatial-recall",avg_correct,NA),vs_practice_accuracy = ifelse(trial_type != "spatial-recall",avg_correct,NA)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(run_id, sr_practice_accuracy, vs_practice_accuracy) %>%
  group_by(run_id) %>%
  summarise(
    sr_practice_accuracy = max(sr_practice_accuracy, na.rm = TRUE),
    vs_practice_accuracy = max(vs_practice_accuracy, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  ungroup()
df_all <- merge(df_all, temp, by = "run_id")

# remove practice & other non-task rows from df
df_all_cleaned <- df_all %>%
  filter(trial_type != "instructions", trial_type != "preload", 
           trial_type != "survey-multi-choice",
           (trial_type != 'html-keyboard-response' | trial_id =='test_trial'),
           (trial_type != 'html-button-response'),
           !grepl("screen", trial_type, ignore.case = TRUE),
         !str_detect(response, "prolific_id"),
         !str_detect(response, "game_description"),
         !str_detect(response, "boring")) %>%
    filter(practice != "true") %>%
    mutate(bid_value = as.integer(gsub("[^0-9]+", "", response)))%>%
  select(-num_stimuli)

# update correct column for all df_all_cleaned
df_all_cleaned <- df_all_cleaned %>%
  mutate(correct = ifelse(trial_type == "spatial-recall",as.integer(score_an, na.rm = TRUE),ifelse(correct_trial=="null",0,as.integer(correct_trial,na.rm=TRUE)))) %>%
  select(-score_an, -correct_trial) %>%
  ungroup()
```
Distribute the bid value to its corresponding block (so each trial per block says the bid value preceding and following this block). Record which block each group of trials is, remove unnecessary columns, and change the datatypes of necessary columns (i.e. subject id). Save the overall average and sd of each participant for each task (to use for normalizing later, if we choose to).

``` {r data_wrangling_bids_blocks}
# spread bid and blocks completed value onto the entire block
# this new column will be how much the participant bid 
sr_practice_num <- 5
sr_per_block <- 12
vs_practice_num <- 15
vs_per_block <- 30
num_blocks <- 20

# Helper function to add a survey-text row if missing
add_survey_text_row <- function(df) {
  if (nrow(df) > 0 && df$trial_type[1] != "survey-text") {
    new_row <- tibble(
      blocks_completed = '0',
      switch_next_block = 'false',
      trial_type = 'survey-text',
      run_id = as.character(df$run_id[1]),
      trial_index = '-1'
    )
    df <- bind_rows(new_row, df)
  }
  return(df)
}

# Function to process data
process_data <- function(data, per_block) {
  data %>%
    nest(data = everything()) %>%
    mutate(data = map(data, add_survey_text_row)) %>%
    unnest(cols = data) %>%
    mutate(
      switch_next_block = ifelse(switch_next_block == "", NA, switch_next_block),
      group = rep(1:(n() %/% (per_block + 1) + 1), each = (per_block + 1), length.out = n())
    ) %>%
    group_by(group) %>%
    mutate(switch_next_block = as.character(switch_next_block)) %>%
    fill(bid_value, switch_next_block, blocks_completed, .direction = "down") %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    select(-group, -bonus, -overall_accuracy, -score_pc, -score_ls, correct)
}
```

```
Now everything is in "final_df"

Remove unecessary columns.
``` {r data_wrangling_remove_cols}
final_df <- final_df %>%
  select(-c(target_rectangle_location, missed_response, sequence, backwards, responses, stimulus, time_elapsed, trial_id, trial_duration, stimulus_duration, target_present, correct_response, ITIParams, numberStim, choices, exp_stage, prolific_id, sr_accuracy, vs_accuracy))
```

Z-score participant bids (to normalize them per participant):
``` {r data_wrangling_bids_zscore}
# add following_bid column (participant bid following that block of trials)
temp <- final_df %>%
  filter(trial_type == "survey-text") %>%
  group_by(subj_id) %>%
  arrange(subj_id,blocks_completed) %>%
  mutate(following_bid = lead(preceding_bid)) %>%
  ungroup()

final_df <- final_df %>%
  left_join(temp %>% select(subj_id, curr_block_num, following_bid),
            by = c("subj_id","curr_block_num"))


# get average bids per participant
temp <- final_df %>%
  filter(trial_type == "survey-text", trial_index != "-1") %>%
  group_by(subj_id) %>%
  summarise(avg_bids = mean(preceding_bid,na.rm = TRUE),stdev_bids = sd(preceding_bid, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()
final_df <- final_df %>%
  left_join(temp, by = "subj_id")

# make a column that represents how different (in sd) the amount they want to switch is from their mean
final_df <- final_df %>%
  mutate(preceding_bid_z_score = if_else(stdev_bids == 0, 0, 
                                         ifelse(is.na(preceding_bid),NA,
                                                ((preceding_bid - avg_bids) / 
                                                   stdev_bids))),
         following_bid_z_score = if_else(stdev_bids == 0, 0, 
                                         ifelse(is.na(following_bid),NA,
                                                ((following_bid - avg_bids) / stdev_bids)))) %>%
  filter(trial_type != "survey-text") %>%
  select(-prevBlockType) %>%
  rename(block_switched=switch_next_block) %>%
  # mutate(z_accuracy = ifelse(game_type == "vs",z_accuracy_vs,z_accuracy_sr), z_rt = ifelse(game_type == "vs",z_rt_vs,z_rt_sr)) %>%
  # mutate(z_rt = as.numeric(z_rt)) %>%
  ungroup()
```

At this point, final_df has all of the relevant data; all of the z-scores are participant specific (for each task and each bid), but it has non-z-scored accuracies as well

In final_df, calculate average performance per block:
``` {r data_wrangling_bids_tasks}
# only z by participant not by both:
# calculate average (and z) accuracy and average (and z) rt per block. (this is when it was z'd by subject AND task)
temp <- final_df %>%
  group_by(subj_id, curr_block_num) %>%
  summarise(avg_z_accuracy = mean(z_overall_correct),stdev_z_accuracy = sd(z_overall_correct,na.rm = TRUE), avg_z_rt = mean(z_overall_rt, na.rm=TRUE),stdev_z_rt = sd(z_overall_rt,na.rm = TRUE), avg_block_accuracy = mean(correct), sd_block_accuracy = sd(correct),avg_block_rt = mean(rt, na.rm = TRUE), sd_block_rt = sd(rt, na.rm = TRUE))%>%
  arrange(subj_id,curr_block_num)
final_df <- final_df %>%
  left_join(temp, by = c("subj_id","curr_block_num"))


# add how many times an individual task has happened
final_df <- final_df %>%
  group_by(subj_id, game_type) %>%
  mutate(task_block_count = cumsum(!duplicated(blocks_completed))) %>%
  ungroup()

# add which trial number every row is within a block
final_df <- final_df %>%
  group_by(subj_id, curr_block_num) %>%
  mutate(trial_count = row_number()) %>%
  ungroup()
```

# PARTICIPANT EXCLUSION

Plot average and median avg subject accuracies for both tasks. Then exclude necessary participants and plot again. 

Exclusion criteria (as of now):
1) participants who never switched between tasks
2) participants who got above 93% accuracy on both tasks (to prevent ceiling effects and to ensure that participants we are studying make some errors); need to adjust this number to be sd above overall mean potentially
3) participants who got below 30% accuracy on both tasks (to prevent inclusion of participants who may not be trying); need to consider this more / adjust this number to be mathematically sound

# MODEL COMPARISON

Looking at likelihood of a trial being correct or incorrect, using generalized linear mixed effects models.

Correct or incorrect is a binary outcome, so here a glm with a logistic link function is used. 

``` {r single_trial_glmms}

complete_data <- na.omit(final_df_excluded[, c("correct","curr_block_num", "game_type", "preceding_bid", "block_switched", "subj_id", "sr_practice_accuracy", "vs_practice_accuracy", "avg_block_accuracy", "trial_index", "preceding_bid_z_score","trial_count")]) %>%
  filter(curr_block_num !=1)

fit.compact_glm_st <- glmer(correct ~ (1 | subj_id), 
               data = complete_data, 
               family = binomial)

# FOR EVALUATIONS

               data = complete_data, 
               family = binomial)


fit.augmented_glm_three <- glmer(correct ~ game_type + curr_block_num + (1 +game_type| subj_id), 
               data = complete_data, 
               family = binomial)

fit.augmented_glm_four <- glmer(correct ~ block_switched + curr_block_num + (1+game_type| subj_id), 
               data = complete_data, 
               family = binomial)

fit.augmented_glm_five <- glmer(correct ~ block_switched + game_type + curr_block_num + (1| subj_id), 
               data = complete_data, 
               family = binomial)

fit.augmented_glm_six <- glmer(correct ~ preceding_bid_z_score*block_switched + game_type + curr_block_num + (1| subj_id), 
               data = complete_data,

fit.augmented_glm_seven <- glmer(correct ~ preceding_bid_z_score*block_switched + game_type + curr_block_num + trial_count + (1| subj_id), 
               data = complete_data, 
               family = binomial)


fit.augmented_glm_eight <- glmer(correct ~ preceding_bid_z_score + block_switched + game_type + curr_block_num + trial_count + (1 + curr_block_num| subj_id), 
               data = complete_data, 
               family = binomial)

compare_performance(fit.compact_glm_st, fit.augmented_glm_one, fit.augmented_glm_two, fit.augmented_glm_three, fit.augmented_glm_four, fit.augmented_glm_five, fit.augmented_glm_six, fit.augmented_glm_seven, fit.augmented_glm_eight)

```
The score log is always -Inf here, should I smooth the predictions and calculate the log loss again? Although results themselves don't look too good.


Now will try to use glmer to predict average of each block per person
